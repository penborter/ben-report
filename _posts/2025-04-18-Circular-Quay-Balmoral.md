This past Good Friday we walked from Circular to Balmoral, continuing the Watsons Bay to Circular Quay segment we'd done in August. Originally we'd planned to walk all the way to Manly, but called it early mainly because we didn't pack enough food and were worried about the hanger building along that last section around Dobroyd Head. Given that it's a non-trading day and you're basically in National Park from the Spit Bridge until North Harbour, we figured it'd be hard to get a snack. To where we stopped the walk was about 15 km (~9 miles), three hours, mostly flat through the middle with some trekking over headlands at the start.

It was a great day to test out my new little Ricoh GRIIIx, which I'd swapped out my X100F for. I still need to dial in the settingsâ€”the photos feel a little bit too contrasty and arty, where I sort of prefer photos that feel like they were taken in a studio. Mostly the lighting, and flatness of the really dark shadows, I think.

Anyway, the weather was beautiful, the walk was great. I think we'll do it again when the weather's a bit cooler, but going the other direction to keep it fresh. And we'll try to link the whole thing up, at least from Manly to Circular Quay, which is probably closer to 20-25 km.

This post was also a good excuse to test out photo layouts, and the lightbox js that I'm starting to implement. Double pictures can be combined with wide now, as you can see above. Click on any of the pictures to zoom in, which should work around the site.
