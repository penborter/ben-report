## Ideas looking for a problem

> Indeed, the techniques forged at Bell Labs—that knack for **apprehending a vexing problem, gathering ideas that might lead to a solution, and then pushing toward the development of a product** that could be deployed on a massive scale—are still worth considering today.

> Men like Kelly and Davisson would soon repeat the notion that there were plenty of good ideas out there, almost too many. Mainly, **<mark>they were looking for good problems</mark>**.  

> The scientists and engineers at Bell Labs inhabited what one researcher there would aptly describe, much later, as “a problem-rich environment.”  

> Sometimes, in describing a new invention that seemed technically brilliant but impractical, industrial scientists would quip that they had found “a solution looking for a problem.” The silicon solar cell needed a problem, as yet unimagined, to appear.  

> “It is not just the discovery of new phenomena, nor the development of a new product or manufacturing technique, nor the creation of a new market,” he later wrote. “Rather, the process is all these things acting together in an integrated way toward a common industrial goal.”  

## Serendipity breeds creativity.

Bell Labs intentionally created this serendipidous environment.

> At the start, **forces that precede an invention merely begin to align, often imperceptibly, as a group of people and ideas converge**, until over the course of months or years (or decades) they gain clarity and momentum and the help of additional ideas and actors.  

> “No attempt has been made to achieve the character of a university campus with its separate buildings,” Buckley told Jewett. “On the contrary, **all buildings have been connected so as to avoid fixed geographical delineation between departments and to <mark>encourage free interchange and close contact</mark> among them.”** 

> The long corridor for the wing that would house many of the physics researchers was intentionally made to be seven hundred feet in length. It was so long that to look down it from one end was to see the other end disappear at a vanishing point. Traveling its length without encountering a number of acquaintances, problems, diversions, and ideas would be almost impossible.  

## Incremental steps towards large leaps
> The 512A was an example of how, if good problems led to good inventions, then good inventions likewise would lead to other related inventions, and that **nothing was too small or incidental to be excepted from improvement**.  

> If anything, **<mark>everyone was considered an engineer</mark> and was charged with the task of making the thousands of necessary small improvements** to augment the phone service that was interconnecting the country.  

> Electronic switching was, from a user’s point of view, an incremental improvement. If you weren’t a phone engineer, it was hard to understand the excitement. After all, everyone could already talk with everyone else.  

## The lifecycle of innovation
> It was the individual from which all ideas originated, and the group (or the multiple groups) to which the ideas, and eventually the innovation responsibilities, were transferred.  

> The public was far **more impressed by new technology than the knowledge that created the technology**. Thus it was almost certainly the case that the inventor of machinery seemed more vital to the modern age than someone—a trained physicist, for example—who might explain how and why the machine worked.  

> Popular technologies spread quickly through society; inevitably, **they are duplicated and improved by outsiders**. As that happens, the original innovator becomes less and less crucial to the technology itself.  

> What’s more, sharing the technology with competitors in the electronics field might be a positive development. AT&T could earn licensing fees from the patent. And if Bell Labs could gain a head start of a few months, **it could take a lead over the competition and reap further rewards as <mark>a host of outside engineers and scientists worked to improve its functionality</mark>**.  

> And eventually, the results were always the same. **All the innovations returned, ferociously, in the form of competition.**
