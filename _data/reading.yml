      - title: All the Names
        author: Jose Saramago
        review: "I'm a sucker for really long lists—for example, the page-long exploration of gravestones presented to Jose in the cemetery when he visits. Great book, probably not as good as *The Gospel According to Jesus Christ*. Somehow Jose (the narrator) comes across as both ignorant and canny, relatable and pretentious; Jose (the character) is pathetic but very likeable. The writing is so good you don't even notice the lack of punctuation, or that we're told only one character's proper name."
      - title: Sea People
        author: Christina Thompson
        review: "Originally recommended in [this review](https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-sea-people-by-christina-thompson). Really a book about the philosophy and the history of science, exploring Western understanding of how basically a single group of people—the Polynesians—settled the huge area between Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island. Thorough and constantly interesting, peeling back the layers as we work through the chronology from European discovery of Polynesia to the present day. Particularly interesting are the parts about 'two ways of thinking', where Europeans struggled to rectify assumptions in their way of thinking with those of the Polynesians."
      - title: Book of the New Sun
        author: Gene Wolfe
        star: yes
        review: "Excellent, mysterious, dense. I can see why the endless discussion about this book has continued online basically since it was released. Fantasy or sci-fi, depending on how much you're paying attention."

      - title: Why Read the Classics
        author: Italo Calvino
        review: 'A collection of essays about "the classics" and about key Western authors. Key quote: "*A classic is something that tends to relegate the concerns of the moment to the status of background noise, but at the same time this background noise is something we cannot do without.*"'

        author: Ben Rich

      - title: Rose/House

        author: Oona Hathaway & Scott Shapiro
        pages: 562
        star: yes
        review: "Really interesting book—the past really was a different country. An exploration of the Kellogg-Briand pact, signed in 1928, which aimed to outlaw war. Obviously, WWII started less than 10 years later, but the authors argue (successfully, I think) that the pact impacted countries' behaviour during the war––particularly the USA––and especially affected the aftermath."
        
      - title: This is How You Lose the Time War
        author: Amal El-Mohtar
        pages: 209
        review: "Quick, easy read. It was fairly light-on, and maybe could have been even shorter––novella? short story, even?––but was still enjoyable."

      - title: The Gospel According to Jesus Christ
        author: José Saramago
        pages: 325
        review: "The title spells out the premise: A story about a much more human Jesus than is represented in the gospels, an unwilling accomplice who tries––and fails––to thwart God's plan. Great, compelling prose. Honestly just a pleasure to read, and it makes me want to read more Saramago (and learn Spanish so I can read it in the original language, along with Borges). I read the translation by by Giovanni Pontiero and Margaret Jull Costa, part of *The Collected Novels of José Saramago*."

      - title: Assassin's Fate
        author: Robin Hobb
        pages: 865
        review: "As with the other series, I read the *The Fitz and the Fool Trilogy* as one book. A fitting end to the entire sixteen-book saga. I'll definitely work my way through the whole thing again, but not soon––I need to process this ending first."

      - title: Blood of Dragons
        author: Robin Hobb
        pages: 448
        review: "I read the combined version of the *Rain Wild Chronicles*, so *Dragon Keeper*, *Dragon Haven*, *City of Dragons*, and this one just felt like one huge book. Still great, maybe stretched a bit more thin than other trilogies in the series. Serves its purpose in properly tying all of the threads together."
