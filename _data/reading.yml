      - title: Matter
        author: Iain M. Banks
        review: "Add this to the fantasy characters in sci-fi settings genre. I feel like further Banks gets from the Culture, the most interesting the stories are."
      - title: Anathem
        author: Neal Stephenson
        star: yes
        review: "I think if I'd read this book as a teenager, I'd have been obsessed. I would have made it a cornerstone of my personality. Even so, still excellent sci-fi within what starts off as a fantasy setting. So interesting, and so fun to parse through all the re-named theorems and concepts. Highly recommend if you're a fan of *[The Name of the Rose](/books#The_Name_of_the_Rose)*, *[The Book of the New Sun](/books#The_Book_of_the_New_Sun)*, *Matter* by Iain M. Banks, or *[Ventus](/books#Ventus)* by Karl Schroeder. Will definitely read again within a year or two."
      - title: The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes
        author: Johnathan Rose
        review: "Starts with a political argument, namely that exposure to great literature was one of the catalysts of the labour movement, and then goes on in a series of case studies. Extremely interesting, and although a lot of the case studies are broadly similar it's still pretty fun each time to read someone's reflections about discovering reading for the first time as an adult."
      - title: Michaelmas
        author: Algis Budrys
        review: "Amazingly relevant given it was written in the 70s, with all of the weird AI wearable startups popping up. A man and his artificial intelligence secretly run the world, and are confronted by interference from another civilization-altering force."
      - title: Castle of Days
        author: Gene Wolfe
        review: "Not as engaging as other collections of essays or short stories I've read (such as, recently, *[Essays One](/books#Essays_One)* by Lydia Davis or *[In Defence of Sanity](/books#In_Defence_of_Sanity)* by G.K. Chesterton), and not as deep as [*The Book of the New Sun*](/books#The_Book_of_the_New_Sun). Some good bits in there, but wouldn't go back again."
      - title: Essays One
        author: Lydia Davis
        review: "Is it weird to read an author's collection of essays before you've read any of their other work? Anyway, a really interesting collection of essays on writing, reading, observation, lists, re-reading, and more. Single words can be whole stories, given enough [context](/notes/context). I strongly relate to her thoughts on the value and process of editing."
      - title: In Defence of Sanity
        author: G.K. Chesterton
      - title: The Way of Kings
        author: Brandon Sanderson
        review: "I hate to say this but I read Brandon Sanderson described somewhere (probably on twitter dot com) as a fantasy Dan Brown. Which—viewed in a positive light—could be a nice comparison. Page turners, straightforward characterisation and prose, not a huge amount of substance but enjoyable. I started on the third book in the series and had to stop because it got a bit too cloying."
      - title: Words of Radiance
        author: Brandon Sanderson
        review: "Started reading when I got sick, as potentially something easy that would last me a few days. It was fun, but I wouldn't go back. It was readable, there was plenty of worldbuilding, and the plotting was interesting, but difficult to compare to authors who are actually good at writing rather than using the words as a vehicle to serve up plot points."
      - title: World of Trouble
        author: Ben Winters
        review: "Fun, but not as good as the other two. Mostly sticks the landing. Not sure if I'm relieved or frustrated about how the conspiracy plot actually played out."
      - title: Countdown City
        author: Ben Winters
        review: "A pretty good sequel, though I'd recommend detoxing between this one and *The Last Policeman* to get rid of some of those end-of-the-world blues."
  - year: "2024"
    books:
      - title: The Last Policeman
        author: Ben Winters
        review: "Bleak throughout, given the setting ([the eschaton is *actually* imminent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanentize_the_eschaton)), but still able to make a fun murder mystery out of it. Everyone's suicidal, so what's one more? Also aided by the fact that I couldn't help but relate to a protagonist who's very tall but a little weird with it."
      - title: The Silverberg Business
        author: Robert Freeman Wexler
      - title: The Stranger
        author: Albert Camus
      - title: Permutation City

        author: Arkady Martine
      - title: A Memory Called Empire
        author: Arkady Martine
      - title: A Triumph of Genius
        author: Ronald K. Fierstein
        review: "I had no idea the extent of Edwin Land's and Polaroid's rate of invention, particularly through WWII, which are set out in the first third of the book. Polarising light filters, heat-seeking missiles, instant photography, an appreciable contribution to the U2 spy plane. Then the fast pace of the first third gives way to an extremely thorough recount of the anti-trust case. This part is interesting, maybe a bit too detailed, although I appreciate the effort that's gone in to distilling a years-long patent dispute into a single book."
      - title: Assassin's Quest
        author: Robin Hobb
      - title: Royal Assassin
        author: Robin Hobb
      - title: Assassin's Apprentice
        author: Robin Hobb
      - title: The Elegance of the Hedgehog
        author: Muriel Barbery
        review: "Charming, and at least a more plausible attempt at having 'genius' characters than *[Conquest](/books#Conquest)*. Maybe a bit similar in that sense, but the gap between the author and the characters' interest in their subject matter (if any) was smaller and so less obvious."
      - title: Conquest
        author: Nina Allan
        review: "This suffered from the same issues as *[Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow](/books#Tomorrow_and_Tomorrow_and_Tomorrow)*, which is that a the 'genius' characters just feel like thin stereotypes, and the authors can't actually represent characters like that with any more depth. Allan has picked out obsessions for the Frank-Bach, Shane Carruth, etc., but it feels like she doesn't have any familiarity with these things, so how can the characters? Anyway, it was fine—lots of people seem to like it."

        author: Peter Watts
      - title: A Fraction of the Whole
        author: Steve Toltz
        review: "Extremely Australia-coded. It was good but it also felt like a book that you'd be given to study in high school. I'm not sure that's a compliment or not. Weirdly nostalgic for a time and for a Sydney that I didn't really grow up in."

      - title: A History of the Bible
        author: John Barton
      - title: Abaddon's Gate
        author: James S.A. Corey
        review: "I had a really strong sense of deja vu reading parts of this, but a strong unfamiliarity with other parts. Not sure what that means, or how helpful a review that it. It's good though, even the parts I'd read before."
      - title: Caliban's War
        author: James S.A. Corey 
      - title: Leviathan Wakes
        author: James S.A. Corey
        review: "Good, but I think the series doesn't get rolling properly until the sequels. I've seen it described as a 'space opera', but I'm not sure it qualifies with only two main characters."

        author: Robin Sloane
      - title: The Trading Game
        author: Gary Stevenson
        review: "Entertaining read about a young trader's introduction to the world of investment banking. Fun, but clearly fiction or hugely sensationalised and not the serious autobiography claimed by the author."
      - title: Redemption Ark
        author: Alastair Reynolds
      - title: "Energy: A Human History"
        author: Vaclav Smil
        review: "A deep dive into how energy has shaped human progress and human societies, from pre-history to the modern day. It feels like Smil builds a strong argument for continuing to increase our energy generation capacity, but never actually makes this point. This book (2017) is an expanded edition of a previous book *Energy in World History* (1994), which might be worth also reading to see if he continued the thread there, then removed it from the update..."
      - title: The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August
        author: Claire North
        review: "For some reason I associate this book with sci-fi, but it's more like light magical realism, groundhog day if the cycle was an entire lifetime and not as funny. It's a nice read, although the second half—which I felt was tense—might drag a bit."
      - title: All the Names
        author: Jose Saramago
        review: "I'm a sucker for shaggy dog lists—for example, the page-long exploration of gravestones presented to Jose in the cemetery when he visits. Great book, probably not as good as [*The Gospel According to Jesus Christ*](/books#The_Gospel_According_to_Jesus_Christ). Somehow Jose (the narrator) comes across as both ignorant and canny, relatable and pretentious; Jose (the character) is pathetic but very likeable. As you'd expect with Saramago, the prose is so good you don't even notice the lack of punctuation."
      - title: Sea People
        author: Christina Thompson
        review: "Originally recommended in [this review](https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-sea-people-by-christina-thompson). Really a book about the philosophy and the history of science, exploring Western understanding of how basically a single group of people—the Polynesians—settled the huge area between Hawaii, New Zealand, and Easter Island. Thorough and constantly interesting, peeling back the layers as we work through the chronology from European discovery of Polynesia to the present day. Particularly interesting are the parts about 'two ways of thinking', where Europeans struggled to rectify assumptions in their way of thinking with those of the Polynesians."
      - title: Book of the New Sun
        author: Gene Wolfe
        star: yes
        review: "I honestly can't believe I was never introduced to Wolfe earlier. Excellent, 10/10 would read again, highly recommended. There's nothing like a series of good etymology puzzles to get you hooked on a book. I can see why the endless discussion about this book has continued online basically since it was released."

      - title: Why Read the Classics
        author: Italo Calvino
        review: 'A collection of essays about "the classics" and about key Western authors. Key quote: "*A classic is something that tends to relegate the concerns of the moment to the status of background noise, but at the same time this background noise is something we cannot do without.*"'

      - title: The Return of the King
        author: J.R.R. Tolkien
        pages: 800
        review: I read the whole trilogy in one go, as if a huge single tome. I can't believe I hadn't read these before, absolute cornerstones of the fantasy genre. I did feel like you could tell that Tolkein was coming from *The Hobbit* through the start of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and the tone of the series got darker from there.

        author: Oona Hathaway & Scott Shapiro
        pages: 562
        star: yes
        review: "Really interesting book—the past really was a different country. An exploration of the Kellogg-Briand pact, signed in 1928, which aimed to outlaw war. Obviously, WWII started less than 10 years later, but the authors argue (successfully, I think) that the pact impacted countries' behaviour during the war––particularly the USA––and especially affected the aftermath."

        author: José Saramago
        pages: 325
        review: "The title spells out the premise: A story about a much more human Jesus than is represented in the gospels, an unwilling accomplice who tries––and fails––to thwart God's plan. Great, compelling prose. Honestly just a pleasure to read, and it makes me want to read more Saramago (and learn Spanish so I can read it in the original language, along with Borges). I read the translation by by Giovanni Pontiero and Margaret Jull Costa, part of *The Collected Novels of José Saramago*."

      - title: Assassin's Fate
        author: Robin Hobb
        pages: 865
        review: "As with the other series, I read the *The Fitz and the Fool Trilogy* as one book. A fitting end to the entire sixteen-book saga. I'll definitely work my way through the whole thing again, but not soon––I need to process this ending first."

        author: Robin Hobb
        pages: 448
        review: "I read the combined version of the *Rain Wild Chronicles*, so *Dragon Keeper*, *Dragon Haven*, *City of Dragons*, and this one just felt like one huge book. Still great, maybe stretched a bit more thin than other trilogies in the series. Serves its purpose in properly tying all of the threads together."
