## The Double Mismatch

There are two fundamental mismatches that compound each other:

1. **Environment Mismatch**: Our brains evolved for ancestral environments but operate in modern ones ([[Out of evolved context]], [[Brain out of water]])

2. **Category Mismatch**: The conceptual categories we use to understand ourselves and our world are historical constructs that may not map onto the underlying reality

## Mismatch Theory: The Brain Out of Water

### Core Insight

Our cognitive and emotional machinery was sculpted by selection pressures that no longer exist.

From [[Book.The Enigma of Reason]]:
> "Flaws" in reasoning appear only because we are faced with contexts that our minds, and reason, did not evolve for

From [[Book.Alchemy]]:
> Sometimes human behaviour that seems nonsensical is really non-sensical – it only appears nonsensical because we are judging people's motivations, aims and intentions the wrong way. And sometimes behaviour is non-sensical because evolution is just smarter than we are.

From [[Book.Atomic Habits]]:
> Your old habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behaviour remain the same.

### Environment Comparison

| Ancestral Environment | Modern Environment |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Small groups (50-150 people) | Anonymous masses, global connectivity |
| Immediate feedback loops | Delayed consequences (investing, diet, climate) |
| Information scarcity | Information overload |
| Local reputation | Context-collapsed social media |
| Face-to-face reasoning/argument | Solitary reasoning, echo chambers |
| Embodied, situated cognition | Abstract, symbolic domains |

### Reasoning as Social Tool

[[Book.The Enigma of Reason]] makes this especially sharp: reasoning evolved for social justification and argumentation, not for solitary truth-seeking. When we reason alone, without the corrective pressure of a disagreeing interlocutor, we fall into confirmation bias and polarization. This isn't a "flaw"—it's a feature misapplied.

## The Construction of Categories: Naming the Mind

### Kurt Danziger's Argument

The psychological categories we treat as natural—"intelligence," "motivation," "behavior," "memory," "learning," "emotion," "personality"—are **not discoveries of underlying natural kinds** but **historical inventions** that emerged in specific institutional contexts (mainly 19th-20th century psychology laboratories and clinics).

### Connection to Box Error

From [[Box Error]]:
> A pair of opposed ideas or categories often actually exist on a spectrum, and have been wrongly quantised.

Two-System Thinking (System 1/System 2) suffers from this. From [[Book.The Enigma of Reason]]:
> Many of the contrasts in such tables—between conscious and unconscious processing, for instance—may involve a difference of degree rather than a dichotomy of kinds.

The very distinction between "conscious" and "unconscious" is a historical construction. We've reified a useful heuristic into an ontological claim.

### Connection to Metaphors We Live By

From [[Book.Metaphors We Live By]]:
> The most fundamental values in a culture will be coherent with the metaphorical structure of the most fundamental concepts in the culture.

> To highlight certain properties is necessarily to downplay or hide others, which is what happens whenever we categorize something.

> The truth of a statement is always relative to the properties that are highlighted by the categories used in the statement.

We don't just use metaphors—**metaphors use us**. The metaphors embedded in our language structure what we can think and what remains invisible.

### Connection to Legibility

From [[Book.Alchemy]] on the perception of certainty:
> If you want to look like a scientist, it pays to cultivate an air of certainty, but the problem with attachment to certainty is that it causes people completely to misrepresent the nature of the problem being examined.

This is the **legibility trap**: we construct categories that make the world readable and manageable, but in doing so we lose the texture that doesn't fit.

## The Synthesis: Constructed Categories in Mismatched Brains

### The Deep Problem

1. **Our brains evolved to categorize**—pattern-matching is fundamental to how we operate ([[Book.Sources of Power]], [[Recognition-Primed Decision Making]])

2. **The categories we use are historically contingent**—they emerged in specific social/institutional contexts

3. **These categories then become reified**—we treat them as natural kinds and build institutions around them

4. **We're now operating with evolved pattern-matching brains using constructed categories in environments that match neither**

### Examples of the Double Mismatch

| Domain | Constructed Category | Mismatch Problem |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Psychology** | "Intelligence" (19th c. testing industry) | IQ tests measure something, but reification creates assumptions about minds |
| **Education** | "Learning" as knowledge acquisition | Evolved brains learn through experience; schooling optimized for credentialing ([[Book.Elephant in the Brain]]) |
| **Medicine** | "Mental illness" as categorical diagnosis | Continuous distributions get pathologized |
| **Economics** | "Rational actor" | Behavior makes sense in ancestral contexts but appears "irrational" by constructed standards |
| **Productivity** | "Motivation" as internal resource | Assumes mind works like a steam engine; ignores [[Environmental Design]] |

### The Press Secretary Meets the Historian

From [[Book.Elephant in the Brain]] on the [[Press Secretary]]:
> Consciousness is not in control, and just generates explanations for behaviour where required.

The twist: **the vocabulary the Press Secretary uses is itself a historical construction**. We confabulate using the conceptual toolkit available in our culture. Someone in 1600 would confabulate using different categories (humors, spirits, sin) than someone in 2021 (dopamine, trauma, anxiety).

The Press Secretary isn't just making up stories—it's making up stories using available narrative frameworks. And those frameworks aren't neutral; they carry assumptions that may be mismatched to reality.

## Looping Effects

Ian Hacking's concept: when we create categories for kinds of people (homosexual, traumatized, autistic, gifted), **the category changes the people who get classified**. They reorganize their self-understanding around the category, which then changes what the category refers to.

Questions to explore:
- How do diagnostic categories in psychiatry create the phenomena they purport to discover?
- How does self-help literature shape the categories people use to understand themselves?
- How does neuroimaging create new forms of selfhood ("my brain made me do it")?

---

## The Metaphor Archaeology

Systematically trace which metaphors structure which domains:
- MIND IS A COMPUTER (information processing, storage, retrieval)
- SELF IS A RESOURCE (energy, willpower, burnout)
- ECONOMY IS A MACHINE (inputs, outputs, optimization)
- SOCIETY IS AN ORGANISM (health, disease, growth)

Each metaphor highlights certain aspects and hides others. What would we see if we used different metaphors?

## Cross-Cultural Variation

If categories are constructed, different cultures should have different categories. They do:
- Japanese concept of *amae* (dependency) has no English equivalent
- Many languages don't have a single word for "mind" distinct from "heart"
- The Western concept of "the self" as bounded individual is not universal

See: [[Joseph Henrich]] - *The WEIRDest People in the World* (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic)

## Practical Implications

1. **Self-Understanding**: Be suspicious of the categories you use to understand yourself. "I lack motivation" uses a constructed category that may not map onto what's actually happening.

2. **[[Environmental Design]]**: Instead of trying to fix yourself using folk psychological categories, design environments that work with evolved tendencies.

3. **Writing as Thinking**: The act of writing forces you to externalize and examine your categories ([[Book.How to Take Smart Notes]]). You can catch yourself using problematic metaphors.

4. **[[Signalling]] Awareness**: Understanding that categories are constructed helps you see through signaling games. "Education" isn't a natural kind—it's a constructed category that serves signaling functions.

Our evolved minds, using historically constructed categories, trying to navigate environments that match neither.
