One of the best days we spent in Japan was doing the walk from Kurama to Kibune, via the Kurama-dera Temple about a half hour north of Kyoto.

The Kurama line runs from Demichiyanagi Station to Kurama Station. The line uses little 2-car rolling stock, and we ended up on one of the special [Kirara](https://eizandensha.co.jp/about/kirara/) panorama trains with side-facing seats and huge glass windows. Missing out on a seat on the way up isn't the end of the world, but it makes a big difference on the way back.

The route is straightforward from Kurama station 


Outside of the uncountable hordes of English-speaking tourists everywhere you go in Kyoto, you can spot some differences in the recommendations for tourists whose first language isn't English. This walk, for example was a German- and Dutch-language guidebook attraction. A lot of the sights to the south of Kyoto seem to be Spanish-language.

Anyway, we'd recommend doing the loop counter-clockwise, from Kurama to Kibune. Mostly because the bulk of the sights are on the Kurama side and most of the walking on the Kibune side, but also because it's nicer to walk up the switchbacks (you see them in the brochure map, below) and down the stairs from Mao-Den than vice-versa.

Honestly the trip starts getting out to the north of Kyoto, aiming for the start of the [Eizan Railway](https://eizandensha.co.jp/en/) in Demachiyanagi. There's a special "Panorama Train", which has seats facing directly out of the windows, perpendicular to the direction of travel.

And not least because in the morning, as you're starting the loop walking up the temple complex switchbacks, the sun pokes almost horizontally through the trees from the south. If you went the other way, you'd end up at Kurama in the middle of the day with the sun directly overhead.
