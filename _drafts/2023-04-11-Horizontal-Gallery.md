I wanted to put together a quick guide for the horizontal photo gallery layout I use for the galleries on this site (e.g. [Europe 2022](https://ben.report/photos/euro)). It comes baked in to the [Stretch](https://stretch.ben.report/) jekyll theme, too.

I'll split this into two parts:
1. Using a Jekyll template to populate a gallery
2. Using CSS to get the populated gallery to behave the way we want

If you're not using Jekyll then I recommend skipping straight to the [CSS section](/posts/horizontal-gallery#css).


## Jekyll Template

We're using a layout called [`photo.html`](https://github.com/penborter/ben-report/blob/main/_layouts/photo.html), which is a basic liquid template that loops through the photos in the gallery, pulls out the URL, caption, and alt text. It allows you to include an intro paragraph at the start of the gallery, which scrolls the same way. 

First we get the data from `photos.yml` in the site's `_data` folder. This will probably be different depending on how your site's data is structured.

```liquid
{% assign gallery = site.data.photos[page.photo_id] %}
{% assign gallery_size = gallery.images.size %}
```

The whole gallery is then wrapped in a div called `horizontal-gallery-wrapper`. Within that div, there are two parts: the initial "meta" paragraph, and then the liquid loop to generate html tags for each image in the gallery. For each image in the gallery, we can fill out an `image-wrapper` div with the url, title, image caption, and alt text.

```html
<div class="horizontal-gallery-wrapper">

  <div class="gallery-meta">
    <div>
      <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
      <p>There are {{ gallery_size }} photos in this set. Photos scroll horizontally (hold Shift and scroll with a mousewheel). ðŸ‘‰</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  {% for image in gallery.images %}
    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <a href="{{ gallery.imagefolder }}/{{ image.name }}"  title="{{ image.text}}">
        <div class="image-caption">{{ image.text }}</div>
        <img class="img-gallery" src="{{ gallery.imagefolder }}/{{ image.thumb }}" alt="{{ image.text }}" loading="lazy">
      </a>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```
## CSS
For this layout, the `gallery-meta` intro paragraph and `image-wrapper` divs behave basically the same as horizontally scrolling components within the main wrapper.

Basically, it's a wrapper divâ€“â€“which enables the horizontal scrollâ€“â€“containing a set of divs for each images / products / projects you want to display. The contents of the inner divs is not important, as long as they each have `height: 100%`.

Firstly the main wrapper, where we set the x-axis overflow to scroll, and we force the content inside not to wrap, i.e. extend as far as needed off to the right of the page. We also add a bit of padding, include a large amount of left padding in this case so that the gallery starts to the right of the menu sidebar.

```scss
.horizontal-gallery-wrapper {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  overflow-y: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  padding: 10px 0;
  padding-left: 13em;
}
```

For each image (including the intro paragraph), we want to the height to be capped at 100% of the container, and add a bit of margin between each of the images. This is where we can add rounded borders or a box shadow to each of the images, if we wanted to.

The gallery-meta div needs some addition formatting to constrain its size and allow the text to display and wrap correctly. Width and padding are flexible, but `vertical-align: top` and `white-space: normal` are required.

```scss
.image-wrapper, .gallery-meta {
  display: inline-block;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0 4px;
}

.gallery-meta {
  width: 500px;
  vertical-align: top;
  white-space: normal;
  padding: 4rem;
}
```

If we want to include a caption for each image (which we did in the HTML above), we will need to format that too. This bottom css rule means that the caption is hidden by default, and appears whenever the image itself is hovered over. As shown below captions should always appear in the bottom left of the screen, and are not tied to the location of the associated image. If you want them to move with the image, you can add `position: relative` to their parent element, in this case the `<a>` tag actually linking to the image.

```scss
.image-caption {
  position: absolute;
  left: 2em;
  bottom: 1.5em;
  display: none;

  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
  color: #fff;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  border-radius: 3px;
  padding: 0.3em;
}

.image-wrapper:hover .image-caption {
  display: block;
}
```

That's all there is to it! No JS required, just forcing the page contents to extend off to the right and allowing the page to scroll. This effect works well with a static sidebar, where the photos will scroll under the sidebar and off the screen to the left. 

Other touches include: adding a page footer into the `gallery-meta` div, and including a `{{ content }}` tag in that same div to allow for a custom blurb for each gallery.
