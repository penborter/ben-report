**TL;DR**: Maybe? It's an efficient play overall (1.20 PPP) but depends on how good a player is throwing good intentional misses. It is a higher-variance play, with a higher expected value probably only for the worst FT shooters.

## Background
Intentionally missing a FT is a common enough play at the end of games, when the shooting team is down two or three points and there isn't enough time left on the clock to keep trading free throws. There have been a couple of notable examples to start the year: both Donovan Mitchell and Luka Dončić used this technique to tie up games very late in the fourth quarter, and both went on to win[^1]. But should this be a more common play? Could some of the NBA's worst free throw shooters benefit from leaving the bricks behind, and instead start tossing boomerangs?

What we're talking about here is throwing the ball at the front of the rim, aiming to get the rebound and end up with the ball in the middle of the lane. The bottom of the NBA's career and season FT% lists is populated by centers, who have the height and catch radius that may improve their odds. 

The key questions are: 
1. How efficient to we expect this play to be?
2. How good could a player be at executing?

## Recent Examples


- Steven Adams (Thunder) against the Rockets (2017-04-23)


So far this season (as of the start of February), there have been 76 possessions where the FT shooter missed their last FT, but got their own rebound to extend the possession. Below are about a dozen good examples from the current season, compiled into a video. These examples (largely) show situations where the rebound goes directly back to the shooter, who then puts up another quick shot. These are from the [Advanced Stats Video](https://github.com/penborter/nba-data/blob/main/utilities/Advanced%20Stats%20Video.ipynb) notebook I put together to download videos for specified plays from NBA Advanced Stats.

## Method
For an NBA season, we can extract all of the possession from the play-by-play data, and find those that contain 

### NBA API
We can use the Python package [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) to get the play-by-play data. Specifically we're using the `leaguegamefinder` and the `playbyplayv2` endpoints. The first will give us a list of IDs for each team's games, and the second will give us the full game play-by-play for each ID. If we do this for each game in a season, we can get a full list of every play in an NBA season. With this, we can move to analysis. 

The key columns in the play-by-play data for this analysis are: 
- `EVENTMSGTYPE`: Play type (e.g. made shot, free throw, rebound, etc.)
- `EVENTMSGACTIONTYPE`: Sub-play type (e.g. 2nd of 2 FTs, stepback, etc.)
- `PLAYER1_ID`: Primary player ID
- `PCTIMESTRING`: Game clock time
- `SCORE`: Current score

I've downloaded and saved the play-by-play data for the last 5 seasons, with some additional columns added (including whether the possession ended on a particular play and which team was in possession at the team). I'll eventually put them up on Google Drive so that anyone can have a play with them. I'd put them up on Github but they're a bit too big (>250MB).   

### Measuring Possessions
We need to measure possessions to measure efficiency, calculating the points per possession (PPP[^2]). 

I won't go into too much detail about how the possessions are measured, but basically the diagram below shows that there are only four ways for a possession to end[^3]. These can be mapped to the `EVENTMSGTYPE` and `EVENTMSGACTION` attributes of each play and the subsequent play, to find each instance of possession-ending scenario during a game. Basically, the function checks whether a play matches the criteria of one of the possession-ending scenarios and, if so, marks the possession over. 

There's a full walkthrough and code example in the [PBP Possessions](https://github.com/penborter/nba-data/blob/main/utilities/PBP%20Possessions.ipynb) notebook on Github.

### Possession Efficiency
For this analysis we're going to be measuring possession efficiency using PPP. In this case it's easy to measure with the play-by-play data: we take the scores at the end of the possession and subtract the scores at the start. 

The only wrinkle is that NBA play-by-play data provides the score as a string for both teams, e.g. `"123-120"`. So we split the string and do the before and after subtraction for both teams. Only one team should have a difference in score (which is our PPP); if both do, you've made a mistake in counting possessions. This happened to me a lot. It seems to be fixed now in [PBP Possessions](https://github.com/penborter/nba-data/blob/main/utilities/PBP%20Possessions.ipynb), so on we go. 

### Free throw offensive rebounds
Beyond marking up possessions, we're also on the lookout for specific possessions where a very particular event occurs: a missed FT is rebounded by the shooter. What that looks like in terms of the data is: a last free throw (`EVENTMSGACTIONTYPE = 10, 12 or 15`[^4]), followed by a rebound (`EVENTMSGTYPE = 4`), both with the same `PLAYER1_ID`. 

There are two main situations once the rebound is secured:
- The ball is pulled back out for another full (14 second) possession; or
- The FT shooter immediately puts the shot up.

To isolate the second situation, we can include a check for a subsequent shot (`EVENTMSGTYPE = 1 or 2`) with the same `PLAYER1_ID` and with a difference in `PCTIME` of less than 5 seconds.

## Results
Over the last 5 years, there have been 271 possessions where a player collects their own rebound and immediately shoots. Those plays have scored **1.20 PPP**. The year-by-year efficiency obviously fluctuates as it's a fairly small sample size each year, but ranges between 1.05 and 1.24 PPP.

### Efficiency
NBA league average FT shooting is 78%, which means these plays need to have a success rate of about 93% to be more efficient that a typical free throw. For really bad shooters (with career average FT% < 60%), this success rate cutoff drops down to a more feasible 72%.

This is probably the most difficult question to answer as part of this analysis: what is a reasonable expected rate of success for these plays? Is it as hard as free throw shooting, or harder? 

A lot of teams don't box out the shooter (at least in these examples), leaving them wide open to pick up a long rebound. Taller players shooting free throws are typically going to be boxed out by a shorter wing (often the 3rd tallest player on the opposing team).

### Downsides
It's difficult––maybe harder than just going for the make––to intentionally miss a free throw in a way that comes right back to you. As Reggie Miller says: "shoot regular because you're gonna miss it anyway!" As Reggie indicates, I'd expect a pretty strong correlation between a player's free-throw percentage and their ability to throw good self-rebounding free throws.

The large majority of these plays in the sample are non-intentional, and are often tipped rebounds––very few of them go directly back to the shooter. For example, if we just look at the 214 plays from 2021-22[^5]
