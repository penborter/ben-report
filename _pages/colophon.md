## Main

This website is built with Jekyll, hosted on Github pages. See the source [here](https://github.com/penborter/ben-report).

It's based on (a heavily modified version of) the [Stretch](https://github.com/penborter/stretch-theme) Jekyll theme. 
At this point I should just start another theme, I don't think the Stretch theme has a whole lot in common with where I've ended up, but that's a project for later.

The base colours are <span class='hex-code' style='--background:#F4F5EF; --text:#455E58;'>#F4F5EF</span> and <span class='hex-code' style='--background:#2A4644; --text:#F4F5EF;'>#2A4644</span>, with two light and two dark accent colours calculated based on those.

Font wise, the entire site is set in [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), except for code snippets which are in [iA Duo](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts).

The [Photos](/photos) page is just html and css, with a bit of optional javascript for arrow key scrolling. I have a [write up](/posts/horizontal-gallery) of how the horizontal galleries work.

## NBA

The [NBA part of the site](https://nba.ben.report) is exactly the same as above, with the addition of [Undefined Medium](https://github.com/andirueckel/undefined-medium) for some of the stats boards.

The base colours are <span class='hex-code' style='--background:#F2E3D9; --text:#2A4644;'>#F2E3D9</span>, <span class='hex-code' style='--background:#FF8833; --text:#2A4644;'>#FF8833</span> and <span class='hex-code' style='--background:#201813; --text:#F4F5EF;'>#201813</span>.

## Additions

I don't have a better place to include them, so I'm listing here some planned / aspirational additions for the site:
- ~~a separate NBA section~~ **DONE** -> [NBA.ben.report](https://nba.ben.report)
- sidenotes
- finished versions of all of the draft posts
- a Jekyll theme based on the current state of the site
- more efficient integration between site data and the sidebar headers, particularly for book pages
