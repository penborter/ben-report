I've lived in Sydney most of my life. These are the best of a large collection, with the other good-but-not-as-good photos in the [Sydney - B](/photos/sydney-2) album, and the bad photos never to see the light of day. Taken with a range of cameras, from my old Canon 550D through to my current Fuji X-S10 and X-100F.
