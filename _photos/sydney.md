I've lived in Sydney most of my life, but didn't really start taking photos of my home town until fairly recently. These are a limited selection of the hundreds of photos gathering dust in my hard drive. It's also largely chronological from left to right, with cameras ranging from my old Canon 550D through to my current Fuji X-S10 and X-100F.
