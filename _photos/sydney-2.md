I've lived in Sydney most of my life. These are a limited selection of the hundreds of photos gathering dust in my hard drive. These are the B-tier photos, good but not great, largely in chronological order, with cameras ranging from my old Canon 550D through to my current Fuji X-S10 and X-100F. There are more (better) Sydney photos [here](/photos/sydney-1).
